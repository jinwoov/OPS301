# Endpoint Acquisition

## Endpoint Agents Are Necessary for Today’s Modern Environment: Here’s Why (Part 1)
- Many users used to have on-premises and physical device that stores all of their data and the same workstation has been used for that user everyday. Nowadays, many companies are having employees to perform their work globally and even on the road.
- Implementing the SecOps practices can leverage endpoint agents.
    - Real-time monitoring: defenders need to detect compromises as it happens-endpoint agents provide that real-time detection.
    - Remote monitoring of global assets and workers: Agent can identify any threat pose to the data
    - As business scale, endpoint agent can monitor new devices as they are spun up.
    - Ability to take action through the agent
    - Assessment that does not require credential scanning. Making agent easier to evaluate sensitive assets for vulnerabilities or active compromise.
    - Limited resource impact. Small footprint ensures that agent isn't a burden on your environment.
    - Streamlined deployment options: if you can standardize to one agent, it can be replicated and deployed across the rest of your environment much faster.
    - Interoperability: Solve multiple use cases.
- Remote and real-time monitoring of global assets and workers
    - Agent provides assessment to the risk that may be arise by user or application. 
- Monitoring of cloud and other virtual infrastructure
    - Agent can access using Amazon AMIs, so that as new assets are spun up or down, they will be automatically assessed for potentially risk.
- Ability to take action through the agent
- Vulnerability assessment that does not require credential scanning
    - Being able to assess and run full scan 
    - Able to monitor without the traditional risk of disruption.
- Footprint: 
    - few thing to references are RAM memory usage, CPU consumption, storage size, bandwidth consumption

## Windows 10 Hardening Techniques

- Hardening operating system is one of the most important steps toward sound information security. 
- Hardening is to reduce any attack surface that attackers have available to them. 
- Only allowing certain things to operate with given authorization and nothing more.
- Hardening is integral part of information security and its is comprise of deter, deny, delay, and detection

### Secure installation
- recommended that user install fresh windows 10 on a system.

### Clean up unwanted programs
- Delete unneeded deleted.

### Encryption
- Bitlocker is a software that encryption that comes with Windows 10. 

### Updates, patches and service packs.
- Update the system

### BIOS configuration
- Configure it so you use system that you need

### Enable guards
- Device Guard, Credential Guard, Application Guard, Exploit Guard

## From Video
- Critical to access any threat. And also you can check threat.
- Agent don't need configuration to get full access, rather it is available anytime
- Footprint: how many ram, cpu, disk space, and network bandwidth.
- have to find the think that match well
- deploy agent that does multiple work with agent. Interoperability 
- just looking at delta
-
