# Change Enablement in ITIL 4

## From Reading
- In ITIL, `change` is defined as the addition, modification, or removal of anything that could have a direct or indirect on services.
- This is particular to chagne in IT infrastructure, applicaitons, documentation, processes, supplier relationships and any other critical components of the service.

## What is change enablement?
- Changing the IT services to ensure risks have been properly assessed, authorizing changes to proceed and managing the change schedule.
- The difference between change enablement and organizational change management is that while organizational change management manges the people aspects of changes to ensure that improvements and organizational transformation initiatives are implemented successfully, change enablement usually focuses on changes in products and services.

## Change type
- There are three changes in ITIL: standard, normal and emergency changes.
- The standard changes are low risk, pre-authorized changes that everything is planned out.
    - Often start by service request, but also may be an operational change
    - Requires full risk assessment and authorization only during creation or modification.
- A normal change is that requires to be scheduled, assessed, and authorized following standard process. 
    - Involves change models based on the type of change determine the roles for assessment and authorization.
    - Initiation is triggered by the creation of a mutual or automated change request.
- The emergency change must be implemented as soon as possible without strictly following the standard process.
    - The assessment and authorization is expedited to ensure quick implementation.

## Change in authority
- It is defined as a person or group who authorizes a change. 
- This can be team, supervisor, manager, CEO, board, customer or regulator.
- It is important to ensure that implementing the change enablement is both efficient and effective. 
- In a high velocity organization, it is common practice to decentralize change approval. 
- Organization adopting DevOps practices might establish systemic approval based on the success of automated checks in the continuous integration/continous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.

- It is important to inform whoever that is affected by the changes.
- `Change schedule` is used to help plan changes, assist in communication, avoid conflicts, and assign resources. 
- It is important to expose the change to all of the stakeholders involved in the changes, through communication channel.

## Change enablement to the service value chain
1. Plan: changes require a certain level of control and the change enablement practice is used to provide it.
2. Engage: Customers and users may need to talk about he changes, depending on the nature of the change
3. Design and Transition: Many changes are initiated as result of new or changed service. 
4. Obtain/Build: Change in components result in change enablement.
5. Deliver and Support: Change may have impact on delivery and support. The information must be communicated to the personnel who carry out this value chain activities. 
6. Improve: The improvement in general requires change to be made, and these should be assessed and authorized in the same way as all other changes.

# From Video

- change management allows transition of emerging technology and processes.
- When there is need of revamping infrastructure, chagne management helps to make the transition a lot smoother.
- it mitigate the risk, however it requires more resources and technology
- IT changes have bigger scope to IT
- Changes management covers more scope
    - Umbrella that covers IT and all of the organization
- Change management is necessary when service is not available or degraded. 
- Anything that is high risk and that need planning and thinking will need change management

1. Create and log the request for change
- contact information of instigator
- people who are going to be affected and
- backup plan
2. It gets sent to the approval
    - can decide to approve, more info, or rejected
3. changes are evaluated
    - Has been done before, and what is the risk that is associated with this change
    - what is return of investment
4. Approve/ Authorize the change
5. Building and testing the project
    - after approving then it will be tested
    - it will be tested on development environment.
    - Once its built and deployed then change management will inform stakeholder
    - change manager will decide rollout and when it will happen
    - Whens the best time for the user
6. After it is deployed, then review it
    - Review will discuss what went wll and what needs to be changed. 
    - Post-mortem
    - If system fails, then it will require emergency change
7. End of the process

- Within this key role there are
    - Change initiator: identifies requirement for change
    - Change coordinator: analyze request
    - Change manager: manages request
    - change advisory board: authorizes requests
    - approver: approves request
    - specialists: process request
- KPI: key performance indicator
    - ticketing works
    - successful changes
        - comparison of the number of competed changed to the number of successful changes
    - Backlog changes
        - changes that are not been implemented.
