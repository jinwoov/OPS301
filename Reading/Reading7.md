# Network Segmentation

## What Is Network Segmentation?
- Network segmentation is an archtectural approach that divides a network into multiple segments or subnets
- Allows network admin to control the flow of the traffics
- Organization use segmentation to improve monitoring, boost performance, localize technical issues and enhance security
- Many organization has adopted the Zero Trust strategy, which Zero trust assumes nobody is trust worthy by default. 
- using the segmentation, network can form a microperimeter around the protect surface. 
- Segmentation can create difficulty to the attackers from access sensitive information even after penetrating perimeter
- The use case for this is  
    - Guest wireless network: company can offer wifi service to guest and contractors. 
    - User group access: creating individual department into different subnets consisting of the authorize group members and the DAAS they need to do their jobs.
    - Segmentation allows a company to isolate applications in public and hybrid cloud environments.
- physical segmentation involves breaking down a larger network into a collection of smaller subnets.
- Logical segmentation involves creating subnets using one of two primary methods: virtual local area network (VLANs) or network addressing schemes. 
- Logical segmentation is more flexible than physical segmentation as it doesn't require no wiring or physical movement of components to accomplish.

## What Is Network Segmentation?
- The purpose of segmentation is to improve network performance and security. 
- Zero trust security 
- Segmentation works by controlling how traffic flows among the parts. you could stop all traffic in one part from reaching another 
- Segmentation is enforced by using internal firewalls, and access control list (ACL) and virtual local area network (VLAN).
- Today, software defined access technology is used to group and tag network traffic.
- It then uses traffic tags to enforce segmentation policy on the network equipment. 
- `Microsegmentation` rely on heavy information in segmentation policies like application layer information.
- Benefit of network segmentation 
    - Segmentation reduces congestion
    - Can limit cyberattack damage
    - protect valuable devices.
    - reduce the scope of compliances
