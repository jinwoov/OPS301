# Networking

## What is a Computer network
- Network is between two or more computers that are connected via wired(cables) or wireless(WiFi). The purpose of this connection are transmitting, exchanging, or sharing data and resources.
- The geographic location defines what computer network as a LAN(local area network) connects computers in a defined physical space, like an office building. For WAN (wide area network) can connect computers across continents. 

## Computer Network Types
- LAN: Local area network. Connects computer over short distance, allowing computers to exchange files, data, and resources. The most common use of LAN is office building, school, or hospital. 
- WLAN: Wireless local ara network. Just like LAN but with wireless connection.
- WAN: Wide area network. Connects computer over a wide area. Connecting billions of computer world wide. 
- MAN: Metropolitan area network. Larger than LANs but smaller than WANs. Cities and government entities typically manages MANs.
- PAN: Personal area network. Serves one person. Across two different device that user use. Like airdrop.
- SAN: Storage area network. Block-level storage. 
- CAN: Campus area network. Corporate area network. Larger than LAN but smaller than WAN. Usually serves college, universities, business campuses.
- VPN: Virtual private network. Secure, point-to-point connection between two network end points.

## Important terms and concepts
- IP address: unique identifier assigned to every device connected to network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. 
- Nodes: connection point inside a network that can receive, send, create, or store data.  
- Routers: physical or virtual device that sends information contained in data packets between networks. Router forwards these data packets until it reaches its destination.
- Switch is a device that connects other devices and manages node to node communication within network. 
    - circuit switching: establishes dedicated communication path between nodes in a network. Preventing other traffic can ravel along that path
    - packet switching: breaking down data into independent component called packets. 
    - Message switching: sends message in its entirety from the source node. 
- Ports: Ports are suite or room numbers if IP address is hotel.
- Network cable types: most common network cable types are Ethernet twisted pair, coaxial and fiber optic. The choice of cable will be depending on the network setting.
