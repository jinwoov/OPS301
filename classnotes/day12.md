Why DevOps

- `Speed, efficiency, and quality` of your software delivery
- Automation
- Small iterative change
    - getting the changes frequntly
- 200 times more frequently with devops in practice
    - 2,555 x faster lead time

- 24 faster recovery speed
- 3x times lower failure rates
- when measuring failure rate
    - if it fails 2 to 3 times a year
- how long does it take in down state
- 2.2 times recommended for the place to work

- more frequent release changes
- IaC
    - infrastructure as a code
- what is dev ops??
    - philosophy
    - vendor specific
    - combine dev + ops
    - reduce SDLC  (system developement life cycle)
    - time to production
- CI/ CD
    - continuous integration / continuous delivery
- CI/CD pipe line
- Agile: methodology 
    - iterative goes through the system
- Waterfall
    - RFC
    - change management 
    - Any changes to the system has to be formally remove
- Agile
    - Iterative
    - MVP: fast and continously go through the cycle.

- CI/CD pipeline
    - agile based software delivery 
    - speed, reliability and accuracy
    - build code
        - know infrastructure <- ops
    - running test (continuous integration)
    - new version of an application (continuous delivery)
    - 
- IAC
    - package
        - windows 10
        - the office 365
        - antivirus
        - Iac package > script
- strict version control eg: github -> script -> system
- Cloud + automation -> makes the netflix the perfect example of dev-ops
- if customer request video and when netflix gets the request, then aws server gets spunned up by the script, after customer is done with the video, it will shutdown the server.
    - this is possible due to cloud and automation
- containerization: packaging the software to the predictable repeatable and immutable (no changes)
    - Remon OS
    - Cloud
    - Dev-ops
    - Docker -> security
    - Kubernetes -> security
- Docker container: fire fox -> artifact (object) - > 
- ability to change ias and still have infrastructure in one piece
- containerization is big 
- microservice can be happen 
- kubernetes - cloud containeriztion product
    - not have to host os

- configuration automation
    - chef, ansible, chef, vagrant, puppet, salt stack
    - system configuration using code
- vagrant: "box" (linux ubuntu 20.04) and (vim) -> virtual box
    - dev environment
- if you are working in development and wants consistent development form
    - vagrant works best
- Create a lamp stack
    - LAMP: Linux, apache, mySQL, php (python sometimes)
- Deploying vagrant box

```
- Dev ops skills and certs that are in demand
    - AWS certs
        - solution architects
        - solution dev associte
        - sys ops admin
    - skill side 
        - python
        - Node js
        - docker 
        - kubernetes
        - chef/ ansible/ puppet
```
