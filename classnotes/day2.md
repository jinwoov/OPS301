- VLAN is something you can divide into two logicals.
- One physical topology
- Logical 
- when two computer is connected to each other, it is still topology
    - very minimum
    - one network
        - one logical
        - one physical
        - wired
- Bus Topology
    - aka line topology
    - single point of failure
    - Half duplex: only one direction, cant be both way
        - bad performance
- ring topology
    - two neighbors connected
    - half duplex when one ring
    - full duplex when two ring
    - full duplex is prefer since it has redundancy
    - all of the computers that has be turned off
- star topology
    - mimics the server
    - server to client
    - central administration
- mesh topology
    - no single point of failure
    - highly resilient
    - dis: $$$, time

Hub
- is one collision domain
- everything that is blasted by hub is going to be go to every computer
- like chat site
    person = send message=> everyone
- sniffing: when you snuck into the hub and you can see everything what everyone is doing.
- A network collision occurs when more than one device attempts to send a packet on a network segment at the same time.
