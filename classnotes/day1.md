## Cloud security
- separation of duty:
    - AWS
    - restore
    - can work in 
- accessibility
- elasticity
- versatility

## VDI
- Horsepower: RDP
- remoting into headless server.
- virtual desktop interface
- Point of sales
- Enterprise of workers 
- Costly deployment
- Microsoft: hypervisor
- Advantage:copy and paste
- policies can be apply
- capex: Capital Expenditure
- Drawback: very high cost
- Advantage: associated with thin client 

## Windows server blade
- DHCP:
- DNS: Server
- Active directory: identity management to manages people who can sign in 
- Domain: website 
    - ie: codefellows.com
    - local: student.codefellows.com
- Windows server for file server
    - file server let you manages identity
    - it points back to shared folder
    - share points
- Raid: what types of raid configuration
    - raid-0: extra 
    - goes by numbers
- Domain and AD can used interchangeably 
    - blade: that looks like they have hard drive its server
- File server will rely on local or ad to 
- file server is there to data vs ad is just to store user's profile.
- server is there to be replaceable.
- when server is replaced it knows the configuration and it can be changed and it will configure to previous settings.

## how to transition from p2p to server side
- are we going to deploy it on-prem or some other server
- RFC: request for change
- change at scale:
- agile devops: they can manage change very differently.


## four dimension model: 
1. organizations & people
    - whos going to use it
2. Information and technology
3. partners suppliers: partner that providing the service
    - are they are going to be there for you when you need a service
    - are they source and purchasing things that how you want it to be
4. value streams & processes
    - added ITIL v4.
    - how does my application impact client
    - how does it add value to the client?
    - high availability
- four things to think about when you are providing to the customer
- if these correlates then service is bringing the value
- service value system (SVS): all the components of services work together to create a service
- think about what client will need instead of you as the service provider can provide

## Four dimension of service
- four components: guiding principal, governance, service value chain, continual improvement practices
    - if you tell people to make strong pw but not implement policy then it is low governance.

## AGILE
- agile: create something that can be usable but not perfect. 
- idea: you just do first iteration then you release it. Then you make changes then you release iteration 2.
- similar github 

- idea -> dev -> bug fix -> release

## Waterfall
- start -> med -> final
